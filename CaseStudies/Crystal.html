				<h2>Background</h2>

					<h3>The Product</h3>
						<p>
						Crystal creates unique personality profiles for every person with an online presence. It then provides advice for how to best communicate with people based on that profile. It has a dashboard which provides the personality profiles and a plugin which gives recommendations on how to write the most effective email based on the personality profile of the recipient. The plugin is exclusively for Gmail in Chrome.
						</p>
				
					<h3>The Problem</h3>
						<p>Crystal was having trouble onboarding new users. Metrics were showing that people weren't installing and using the plugin. He noticed that with customers he spoke to individually this wasn't a problem. Something he was saying to users wasn't coming through in the online onboarding process.</p>
				
					<h3>The Goal</h3>
						<p>Provide an in-depth analysis of the current experience and hypothesis on what wasn't working backed by research and user testing. Using that information we would mock-up a new onboarding process with the goal of creating a moment which would make the user believe in the product, encouraging them towards action which should result in repeat engagement.</p>
				

			

		
			<h2>Process</h2>
				<h3>Research</h3>
					<h4>Initial Audit</h4>
						<p>The first step was for each member of the team to experience the onboarding for themselves.</p>

						<p>I decided to set myself up at my desktop with a screen recording. That way I could talk through what I was thinking and feeling at each step and have the video for reference later on. I took screenshots of the video with notes on the moments I felt something either worked really well or didn't work at all.</p>

						<!-- IMG SCREENSHOT W/NOTES-->

						<p>Afterwards the team regrouped to talk about our experiences. We drew out a comprehensive user flow and compared notes on what we thought we could improve and what we should preserve. We also formed a plan for how to tackle the challenge ahead.</p>

						<!-- IMG WHITEBOARD W/FLOW-->


					<h4>User Research</h4>
						<p>As a team, we interviewed some of the customers Drew had personally spoken with to figure out what it was that he was saying which changed their minds about using the product. We found that many of Crystal’s users were personal friends or acquaintances who had a strong desire to help Drew out. It was only through using the product that they saw the value and came to rely on it. If Crystal was going to draw in new customer’s on it's own we were going to need to make some drastic changes.</p>

						<!-- DOCUMENTATION INTERVIEWS -->


					<h4>User Interviews & Testing</h4>

						<p>Individually we did additional interviews and testing with potential users. The goal was a broader understanding of emotions and attitudes around communicating in general and specifically with strangers. </p>

						<p>At the end of our research the team compared notes and looked for patterns of what users struggled with and in attitudes about communication. Through these questions we learned that people are frequently apprehensive about communicating with people they don’t know- even experienced sales people. Whether it’s anxiety about landing a new client or how you’ll along with a new teammate almost everyone worries about how their words will be received by people they don’t know well. Most people also agree it’s a good idea to tailor your communication style based on the personality of the person you’re talking to- but that’s only possible if you know the person well. Another thing we learned is that people tend to do some online research before making contact reassuring us that utilizing a tool like Crystal doesn’t seem completely foreign.</p>

						<p>We also discovered there would be some big trust barriers we would need to overcome in order to give users the best experience possible. In order to analyze your connections Crystal needs access to user’s LinkedIn accounts. And in order to provide tips on how best to write emails based on recipient Crystal needs access to user’s Gmail. Providing access to these accounts provoked feelings of anxiety and reluctance. We needed to let users why providing this information would benefit them and that access to this information would never be abused. </p>

						<!-- PICTURE WHITEBOARD FROM THIS MEETING? -->
						<p>Based on everything we learned we created some hypotheses about what was going wrong for Crystal:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Lack of explanation leads to distrust of the product.</li>
								<li>Users are more likely to complete an activity if they understand the process and time commitment upfront.</li>
								<li>Users will continue through steps if given rewards, positive feedback and/or encouragement along the way.</li>
								<li>The product’s value proposition needs to be clear and experienced from the start and reiterated throughout the process.</li>
								<li>Users can understand one clear path but too many options create confusion and frustration.</li>
								<li>If there is a desired path for the user to take, highlight that path upfront and explain why it’s better than other options.</li>
								<li>Onboarding should have a “wow” moment that hooks the user.  This moment should support the value proposition and goals of the product/business. </li>
							</ol>

						<p>We used these hypotheses to inform the next step of our process. They also helped identify low hanging fruit- quick, easy changes that could make a big impact. Things like adding a progress bar so users would know how many steps they had ahead of them, priming users before asking permissions so they would feel more confident about providing it, and encouraging users.</p>

					<h4>Reading</h4>
						<p>For a better understanding of how behavior can be influenced by design I also did some research on emotional design in the form of reading.</p>
						<p>Designing for Emotion contains a ton of valuable information on the intersection of design and emotion. And Hooked provided a model of how to create repeat user engagement.</p>
						<p>I also scoured the web for known best practices in onboarding users. UserOnboard.com provided some wonderful insights as did a podcast from my friends at Fresh Tilled Soil.</p>

				<h3>Brainstorm</h3>
					<p>We began the next step by diverging  to brainstorm ideas for how we could improve Crystal’s onboarding individually.</p>

					<p>I decided to focus on the ultimate goal of the user and how that could impact our recommendations.  Though all of our interviews it seemed clear that at it’s core Crystal is ultimately about the simple and fundamental human need to connect with other people. Though it is a simple idea it’s also powerful one. My research suggested this insight could used to help create the user engagement Crystal was looking for. I decided the value proposition which is front and center on the homepage should place Crystal at the core of this fundamental human need as a powerful new tool for achieving it.</p>

					<!-- PICTURE OF CRYSTAL USER W/FIRE FLOWER -->

					<p>Next, I looked at the task flow to figure out what the steps should be and how they should be ordered. Because Crystal has one part (the dashboard) which is accessible in any browser and another part (the plugin) which can only be used in Gmail in Chrome, I decided a flow which gives the most users the most access to the product the in the fewest steps would be best. The plugin being restricted to one email provider in one browser means fewer people can use it even if they want to. That suggested that it should be that last step in the process.</p>

					<!-- SKETCH OF FLOW -->

					<p>It seemed clear that the best practice in onboarding is to get users inside the product- helping create understanding through playing with it. So I came up with a way to get users inside Crystal and learning by doing more quickly. This also makes the task at hand much more fun for users.</p>

					<!-- PICTURE OF SKETCH -->

					<p>The team converged again. Each of us bringing big new ideas to the table- and some similar ideas too. Together we sorted out what seemed like the best solution to the problem and cobbled together an entirely new onboarding process for Crystal.</p>

				<h3>Design</h3>
					<p>Based on the flow drawn on the whiteboard from our team brainstorming session one team member started the wireframes and then handed them off to me to complete. </p>
					
					<!-- PICTURE OF WIREFRAMES -->

					<p>I threw the wireframes into Invision to create a clickable prototype and immediately tested it out. The feedback was positive but I also gained some valuable new insights. I made some changes and tested again with even better results.</p>

			<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>Although our design needs more testing and more iterations it seems clear from initial feedback that we made some tremendous improvements. By putting ourselves in the shoes of our users we created a much more empathetic experience which allows our users to then communicate with empathy. Empathy for everyone!</p>
