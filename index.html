		ACT I
SCENE I. Before LEONATO'S house.

    Enter LEONATO, HERO, and BEATRICE, with a Messenger 

LEONATO

    I learn in this letter that Don Peter of Arragon
    comes this night to Messina.

Messenger

    He is very near by this: he was not three leagues off
    when I left him.

LEONATO

    How many gentlemen have you lost in this action?

Messenger

    But few of any sort, and none of name.

LEONATO

    A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings
    home full numbers. I find here that Don Peter hath
    bestowed much honour on a young Florentine called Claudio.

Messenger

    Much deserved on his part and equally remembered by
    Don Pedro: he hath borne himself beyond the
    promise of his age, doing, in the figure of a lamb,
    the feats of a lion: he hath indeed better
    bettered expectation than you must expect of me to
    tell you how.

LEONATO

    He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much
    glad of it.

Messenger

    I have already delivered him letters, and there
    appears much joy in him; even so much that joy could
    not show itself modest enough without a badge of
    bitterness.

LEONATO

    Did he break out into tears?

Messenger

    In great measure.

LEONATO

    A kind overflow of kindness: there are no faces
    truer than those that are so washed. How much
    better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping!

BEATRICE

    I pray you, is Signior Mountanto returned from the
    wars or no?

Messenger

    I know none of that name, lady: there was none such
    in the army of any sort.

LEONATO

    What is he that you ask for, niece?

HERO

    My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.

Messenger

    O, he's returned; and as pleasant as ever he was.

BEATRICE

    He set up his bills here in Messina and challenged
    Cupid at the flight; and my uncle's fool, reading
    the challenge, subscribed for Cupid, and challenged
    him at the bird-bolt. I pray you, how many hath he
    killed and eaten in these wars? But how many hath
    he killed? for indeed I promised to eat all of his killing.

LEONATO

    Faith, niece, you tax Signior Benedick too much;
    but he'll be meet with you, I doubt it not.

Messenger

    He hath done good service, lady, in these wars.

BEATRICE

    You had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it:
    he is a very valiant trencherman; he hath an
    excellent stomach.

Messenger

    And a good soldier too, lady.

BEATRICE

    And a good soldier to a lady: but what is he to a lord?

Messenger

    A lord to a lord, a man to a man; stuffed with all
    honourable virtues.

BEATRICE

    It is so, indeed; he is no less than a stuffed man:
    but for the stuffing,--well, we are all mortal.

LEONATO

    You must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is a
    kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick and her:
    they never meet but there's a skirmish of wit
    between them.

BEATRICE

    Alas! he gets nothing by that. In our last
    conflict four of his five wits went halting off, and
    now is the whole man governed with one: so that if
    he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let him
    bear it for a difference between himself and his
    horse; for it is all the wealth that he hath left,
    to be known a reasonable creature. Who is his
    companion now? He hath every month a new sworn brother.

Messenger

    Is't possible?

BEATRICE

    Very easily possible: he wears his faith but as
    the fashion of his hat; it ever changes with the
    next block.

Messenger

    I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books.

BEATRICE

    No; an he were, I would burn my study. But, I pray
    you, who is his companion? Is there no young
    squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil?

Messenger

    He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.

BEATRICE

    O Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease: he
    is sooner caught than the pestilence, and the taker
    runs presently mad. God help the noble Claudio! if
    he have caught the Benedick, it will cost him a
    thousand pound ere a' be cured.

Messenger

    I will hold friends with you, lady.

BEATRICE

    Do, good friend.

LEONATO

    You will never run mad, niece.

BEATRICE

    No, not till a hot January.

Messenger

    Don Pedro is approached.

    Enter DON PEDRO, DON JOHN, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, and BALTHASAR

DON PEDRO

    Good Signior Leonato, you are come to meet your
    trouble: the fashion of the world is to avoid
    cost, and you encounter it.

LEONATO

    Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of
    your grace: for trouble being gone, comfort should
    remain; but when you depart from me, sorrow abides
    and happiness takes his leave.

DON PEDRO

    You embrace your charge too willingly. I think this
    is your daughter.

LEONATO

    Her mother hath many times told me so.

BENEDICK

    Were you in doubt, sir, that you asked her?
